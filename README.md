# Strings and Lists

### Date: 9/3/19

### Summary

Exercises include string manipulation, working with nested for loops. One interesting take away was that in `tip_calculator.py`, I wanted the total_bill function to return two variables. Normally, python functions return one calculation but, I learned that it's possible to return more than one in the form of a tuple which can then be parsed.
